//!
//! ^Creates a buffer with 1 extra byte compared to the file size for safety

//!     - amount_str: number of lines in the file
//!
//! @note Allocated memory must be freed by the caller
//! @warning Function uses assert for pointer name_of_file
//! @warning Function checks file status using fstat to get file size in bytes.
//!          If fstat fails, error message is printed to stderr and program exit with EXIT_FAILURE
